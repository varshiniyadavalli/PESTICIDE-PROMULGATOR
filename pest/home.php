<p align="center">Here our idea is to suggest the list of chemicals which are suitable and available in market for the diseases. So we are developing an application that will be suggesting respective pesticides suitable for specific crop(plant).Here our application will accept the input attributes(like crop type) then it will suggest the suitable pesticide through the database (which contain agricultural scientists and engineers reviews).We may also provide chemical composition of the pesticide which helps one to have alternative companyâ€™s product.
Although application is really helpful, our society should make campaigns on its awareness and usage.
Finally we may expect an efficient outcome of agriculture.</p>
